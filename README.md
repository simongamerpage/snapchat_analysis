# snapchat_analysis

The following repository maintains a small exerpt from an exploratory analysis of Snapchat User data. Here, I (Simon Page) requested a data download from Snapchat of my personal user data to analyze what Snapchat (and other large corporations, by extension) collects on me personally. 

Given the very personal nature of these data, non-personal R Script and redacted visualizations are only uploaded as representative examples. This data is downloadable by any user of the app, assuming they opt into a number of "features" (i.e., sharing location history). 

The goal of this analysis is to show the detailed nature of Snapchat data collection and apply this scarily-accurate data to surveillance and our digial privacy at large in a palatable way for the average consumer that lacks data manipulation skills.

NOTE: This project was completed for a final grade in an American Culture course at the University of Michigan. More specifically, in the Spring term, 2020, in a course on Surveillance and the Digital Age.
